     *   - If the Team has an Override for a specific Artifact, that is stored.
     *   - If the Team has an Override for a Group that contains the Artifact, that is stored.
     *   - For the Organization the Team belongs to:
     *     - If the Organization has an Override for a specific Artifact, that is stored.
     *     - If the Organization has an Override for a Group that contains the Artifact, that is stored

     *  For example, a User may be a member of a Team that controls a group of Artifacts, but the User may not
     *   be able to be trusted with a specific Artifact. The Team may have the Group Override granting Write access,
     *   and the User may have an Artifact Override granting Read access.
